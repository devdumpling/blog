5.10.18

Today is day 1 of Flutter. Let's give it a go. Today will mostly be installation stuff, as I doubt I'll get much further than that. Hang on to your butts <3

ALRIGHT. Flutter is installed and I had to add c++ libraries because I did a fresh install of Ubuntu 16, but now I have to get Android Studio up and running... again. It wasn't hard last time but the download takes forever so... probably wrapping it up for today.

Yee.
