5.10.18

Today is day 1 of Flutter. Let's give it a go. Today will mostly be installation stuff, as I doubt I'll get much further than that. Hang on to your butts <3

ALRIGHT. Flutter is installed and I had to add c++ libraries because I did a fresh install of Ubuntu 16, but now I have to get Android Studio up and running... again. It wasn't hard last time but the download takes forever so... probably wrapping it up for today.

Yee.

Okay actually it finished really fast? I guess the last time I installed it I must've been on shit internet or playing too many games or something.

Added some more libraries (stdc shit, I think) for Android Studio. Next step appears to be adding plugins for Flutter and Dart to Android Studio.

Alright, in order to setup the emulator I need to setup VM Acceleration which I don't remember how to do and it's approaching break time. Next steps will be setting that up and getting the emulator running and then hopefully on to first Flutter app!
