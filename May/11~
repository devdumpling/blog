Alright, good start so far today. Went in to configure VM acceleration.
All in all, the process wasn't bad. I remembered what the rough part was.
I had to link updated stdc++ libs from /usr/lib to the Sdk's ones because
for whatever reason they use the wrong ones still. The solution was the
same workaround I used before. After some testing, we are up and running
fully in Android studio. I think. Off to check the flutter doctor and make
sure everything is gucci then the real fun begins.
