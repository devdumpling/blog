Alright, good start so far today. Went in to configure VM acceleration.
All in all, the process wasn't bad. I remembered what the rough part was.
I had to link updated stdc++ libs from /usr/lib to the Sdk's ones because
for whatever reason they use the wrong ones still. The solution was the
same workaround I used before. After some testing, we are up and running
fully in Android studio. I think. Off to check the flutter doctor and make
sure everything is gucci then the real fun begins.

IT WORKS HAHAHA YES GOD YES

Ok. The hot reload is pretty damn fancy. I even noticed it reallocating cache
when the number got too big, but that might be an Android Studio thing more
than a Flutter thing. EIther way, damn this is badass.

Heheh I used to have to count beans at this cafe I worked at (it was a vegan
cafe in Cambridge if that tells you anything). So, I made a bean counter app
using the base app for Flutter. #basicallyhirable

Turn up. Gonna grab some lunch and come back to this later.
